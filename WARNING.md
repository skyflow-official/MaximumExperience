# WARNING

If you modify a part that is not permitted by ZEROTech, you may receive some sanctions from ZEROTech.

**This is a homebrew fix that has never been negotiated with ZEROTech, and our project does not recommend homebrew fixes to anyone who cannot take this warning. If you cannot accept the warning, please use ZEROTech's official parts as they are. Even so, if you can afford the warning, please proceed.**
